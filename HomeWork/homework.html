<h2 id="ls" style="background: darkkhaki">Lisa Simpson</h2>
<p> Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is the middle
    child and most accomplished of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The
    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while
    waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in
    Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger
    sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family were
    moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989.

<h2 id="mb" style="background: darkseagreen">Mr.Bruns</h2>
<p>Although originally conceived as a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons'
    lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a
    stereotype of corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to
    remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite frequent interactions—which has become a recurrent joke)
    and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting on his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to
    expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to
    everyday life. Conan O'Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old
    age and extreme wealth. His house is called Burns Manor.

<h2 id="kc" style="background: red">Krusty the Clown</h2>
<p>Krusty was created by cartoonist Matt Groening and partially inspired by Rusty Nails, a television clown from
    Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon. He was designed to look like Homer Simpson with clown makeup, with the
    original idea being that Bart worships a television clown who was actually his own father in disguise. His voice is
    based on Bob Bell, who portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989 in
    the Tracey Ullman Show short "The Krusty the Clown Show".
